### Hi there, I'm Ryan!

I'm a student at Virginia Tech. I'll be finishing my bachelor's in CS in Summer '26, and my masters in CS with a concentration in Data Analytics/AI in Spring '27!

I listen to music a lot, and I'm currently working on my passion project of making tools to improve my experience using Spotify.

I'm experienced with Java and Python, and I'm currently learning React and Typescript.

If you'd like to reach out, DM me on LinkedIn @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-p-cohen/
